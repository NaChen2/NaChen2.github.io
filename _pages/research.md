    title: "Tropical forest disturbance monitoring"
    excerpt: >
      This research is mainly based on real-time monitoring of tropical forests by harmonizing Landsat and Sentinel-2 data. The key innovation combines change detection (BFAST Monitor) with machine learning (random forest) for earlier forest disturbance warnings.
