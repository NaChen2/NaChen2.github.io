## Research Interests

My research focuses on applying remote sensing to better understand when, where, how and why tropical forest changes and address critical environmental challenges. My work combines advanced geospatial techniques with data-driven approaches to provide valuable insights into land use land cover change (forest cover), forest dynamics, and natural resource management. My research interests are mainly tropical forest disturbance, regrowth monitoring, and forest carbon stock estimation based on multi-source remote sensing data.

## Research Questions

- How can remote sensing be leveraged to monitor and understand ecosystem changes in tropical forests over space and time?
- How can satellite data improve our ability to assess forest recovery, structure, and carbon dynamics at regional to global scales?
- How can scalable, data-driven approaches support forest conservation, land management, and climate mitigation efforts?
